# JavaScript Playground

JavaScript Playground is an application that lets you use your own editor to write some code and then log 2 console and have it appear in your browser for viewing purposes.

The purpose of this project is to provide training demos using the browser as the printable output.

Open up `src/main.js` in your editor, then open up a browser to localhost:3000, and start writting code, then everytime you save, you should see anything you logged in the browser.
